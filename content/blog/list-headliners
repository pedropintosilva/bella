I have been using Inkscape 1.0 daily and it has come a long way with really cool features and improved workflow. For example the image you see above shows a set of new multi-color icons and how easy is to change theming without messing with config files plus some other neat options!
I had a blast talking with André Paula and João Jotta from LinuxTechPT podcast. It's really something to be able to speak again in my own idiom specially when I often don't have that chance (since I'm in Prague).
This blog is my attempt to log my findings, contributions or related events in the FOSS world. And since I work at Collabora Productivity – the driving force behind putting LibreOffice in the cloud – expect to see a lot of cool stuff regarding office tools.
