<h1>Zammad</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Zammad is a web-based open source helpdesk/customer support system with many features to manage customer communication via several channels.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The folks over Zammad have requested my help in their ongoing effort to make the best CRM system in the business. They were not looking for a completely new redesign neither it was their intention to break some of the flows that their current user-base grew with. Thus the goal was to simplify what it could be simplified while emphasizing the main user stories using nothing else than open source software.</p>

<p>My analysis started with reading the Zammad websites, Git repository, and their user forum. I also used the Zammad system for my own customers. Due to time and financial constraints we decided to focus solely on the main navigation. Here are a couple of screencasts documenting possible flaws, missing states or convoluted elements in the current application.</p>
